## Quick Start Guides

### Container Development

Bazzite AI provides two development container variants:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CPU-Only (Base)
Perfect for general development without GPU requirements.

```bash
# Using VS Code
code .
# Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Reopen in Container"

# Using Apptainer (HPC/Research)
ujust apptainer-pull-container
ujust apptainer-run-container

# Using Podman directly
just pull-container
just run-container
```

[Learn more ‚Üí](containers/usage.md)
:::

:::{tab-item} GPU Accelerated (NVIDIA)
Full CUDA support for AI/ML workflows.

```bash
# One-time GPU setup
ujust setup-gpu-containers

# Using VS Code (GPU auto-detected)
code .
# Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Reopen in Container"

# Using Apptainer with GPU
ujust apptainer-pull-container-nvidia
ujust apptainer-run-container-nvidia

# Using Podman with GPU
just pull-container-nvidia
just run-container-nvidia
```

### Windows Applications

```{admonition} WinBoat Integration
:class: tip

Run Windows applications natively on Bazzite AI with containerized Windows VM technology.
```

```bash
# Launch WinBoat GUI
winboat

# First-time setup downloads Windows container (~10GB)
# Then launch Windows apps as native Linux windows
```

## System Integration

### Flatpak Applications

```bash
# Install all recommended apps
ujust install-flatpaks-all

# Or install by category
ujust install-flatpaks-dev         # VS Code, GitKraken, etc.
ujust install-flatpaks-productivity # Firefox, Chromium, LibreOffice
ujust install-flatpaks-media        # GIMP, Inkscape, Blender
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Install pixi package manager + devcontainers CLI
ujust install-dev-tools

# Install Claude Code CLI
ujust install-claude-code

# Install extra fonts
ujust install-fonts
```

### Service Management
