## Installation Options

```{warning}
Bazzite AI **only supports KDE Plasma variants**. GNOME variants are not officially supported.
```

### Option 1: Rebase from Existing Bazzite

If you already have Bazzite installed, you can rebase to Bazzite AI:

```bash
# Rebase to Bazzite AI (KDE Plasma unified variant)
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/atrawog/bazzite-ai:latest

# Reboot to apply changes
systemctl reboot
```

### Option 2: Clean ISO Installation

Download the latest ISO installer:

```{note}
ISOs are distributed via BitTorrent due to GitHub's 2GB file size limit.
```

1. **Download torrent file** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/atrawog/bazzite-ai/releases)
2. **Open with BitTorrent client** (Transmission, qBittorrent, etc.)
3. **Verify checksum** after download
4. **Create bootable USB** with tools like Ventoy or Rufus
5. **Boot and install**

### Option 3: Virtual Machine Testing

Test Bazzite AI in a VM before committing:

```bash
# Pull the latest container image
just pull

# Build QCOW2 image
just build-qcow2

# Run in browser-based viewer
just run-vm
```

The VM will be available at `http://localhost:8006+` with 4 cores, 8GB RAM, and 64GB disk.

## First Steps After Installation

### 1. System Update

```bash
# Update to latest version
ujust update

# Or manually
rpm-ostree upgrade
```

### 2. Install Flatpak Applications

```bash
# Install all recommended flatpaks
ujust install-flatpaks-all

# Or install by category
ujust install-flatpaks-dev              # Development tools
ujust install-flatpaks-productivity     # Browsers & office
ujust install-flatpaks-media            # Media & graphics
```

See the complete list of available categories:
```bash
ujust --list | grep flatpaks
```

### 3. Set Up Development Tools

```bash
# Install pixi package manager + devcontainers CLI
ujust install-dev-tools

# Or install individually
ujust install-pixi
ujust install-devcontainers-cli
```

### 4. Configure GPU Access (NVIDIA only)

If using NVIDIA GPU with containers:

```bash
# One-time GPU container setup
ujust setup-gpu-containers
```

See {doc}`../user-guide/containers/gpu-setup` for details.

### 5. Install Additional Fonts

```bash
# Install extra fonts via Homebrew
ujust install-fonts
```
