## Detailed Findings

### Positive Findings ✓

1. **Complete Installation**
   - devcontainers-CLI fully installed and functional
   - Apptainer operational
   - All ujust commands available
   - All just commands available

2. **GPU Support**
   - NVIDIA GPU detected by Apptainer
   - GPU-specific commands available
   - Both CPU and GPU variants present

3. **Command Organization**
   - Production commands: ujust (end-users)
   - Development commands: just (developers)
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Documentation Integration**
   - Commands include helpful descriptions
   - Quick start guides in command output
   - Links to external documentation

### Notable Observations

1. **GPU Detection Difference**
   - nvidia-smi: Cannot communicate with driver
   - Apptainer: Successfully detects GPU
   - Likely: Apptainer uses different detection method (device files vs driver API)

2. **Dual Command Sets**
   - ujust: 6 commands (production, simpler)
   - just: 10 commands (development, more options)
   - Good separation for different use cases

3. **Container Variants**
   - Base/CPU-only: For systems without GPU
   - NVIDIA/GPU: For GPU-accelerated workflows
   - Proper naming convention maintained

- Kernel: 6.16.4-116.bazzite.fc42.x86_64
- Container Runtime: Podman 5.6.2, Docker 28.5.1

**Installed Software:**
- devcontainers-CLI: v0.80.1
- Apptainer: v1.4.3-1.fc42
- npm: (global installation)

**GPU:**
- NVIDIA GPU detected by Apptainer
- nvidia-smi driver communication issues
- GPU passthrough available via Apptainer --nv flag

---

## What Was NOT Tested

The following were **not** executed (by design, to save time/bandwidth):

1. **Container Pulls** (~6GB download)
   - ujust apptainer-pull-container
   - ujust apptainer-pull-container-nvidia
   - Reason: Large downloads, on-demand feature

2. **Container Execution**
   - ujust apptainer-run-container
   - ujust apptainer-run-container-nvidia
   - Reason: Requires containers to be pulled first

3. **Build Operations** (time-consuming)
   - devcontainer build
   - just build-container
   - Reason: 15-30 minutes per build

4. **GPU Computation**
   - Actual CUDA/GPU workloads
   - Reason: Would require container execution + GPU libraries

**These can be tested following MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md**
