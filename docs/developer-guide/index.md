## Quick Start

### Building Container Images

```bash
# Build the OS container image
just build

# Build development containers
just build-container         # CPU-only
just build-container-nvidia  # GPU variant
```

### Building Bootable Images

```bash
# Build ISO installer
just build-iso

# Build VM image (QCOW2)
just build-qcow2

# Run VM for testing
just run-vm
```

### Creating Releases

```bash
# Complete release workflow
just release

# Individual steps
just release-build-isos
just release-create-torrents
just release-seed-start
just release-create
```

## Architecture Overview

### Container-Based OS Image

```{admonition} Build Process
:class: tip

Bazzite AI builds bootable container images using:

1. **Base Image:** `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-nvidia-open:stable`
2. **Build Process:** Optimized Containerfile with layer caching
3. **Output:** Signed container image ‚Üí GitHub Container Registry
```

### Build Script Execution

```{dropdown} Layered architecture for optimal caching
:open:

Each script executes in a separate Containerfile RUN layer:

**Layer 1-2:** System files and image metadata
**Layer 3:** Core Fedora packages (~500MB, stable)
**Layer 4:** External repos/COPR/VS Code/Docker (~100MB, moderate changes)
**Layer 5:** System configuration (~10MB, frequent changes)
**Layers 6-11:** Services, cleanup, finalization

**Performance:** Config-only changes rebuild in ~30-60 seconds vs. first build ~6-8 minutes.
```

## Testing Utilities

### Local ujust Recipe Testing

```{warning}
Bazzite AI is an **immutable OS** - the `/usr/` directory is read-only. Changes to justfiles only take effect after rebuilding and rebasing.
```

For rapid development, use the testing wrapper:

```bash
# Test without system modifications
./testing/ujust-test install-devcontainers-cli

# Or use usroverlay for full environment testing
sudo ./testing/apply-usroverlay.sh --transient
```

See {doc}`testing/index` for complete testing workflows.

## Key Files

### Build Configuration

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 40 60

* - File
  - Purpose
* - `Containerfile`
  - OS image build definition
* - `Containerfile.containers`
  - Development container build (unified multi-stage)
* - `image-versions.yaml`
  - Base image tracking (managed by Renovate)
* - `iso.toml`
  - ISO installer configuration
* - `image.toml`
  - VM/raw image configuration
```

### Source Code

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 40 60

* - Directory
  - Contents
* - `build_files/`
  - Build scripts executed during image build
* - `system_files/`
  - Files copied to OS root (configs, scripts, justfiles)
* - `docs/`
  - Documentation (this site!)
* - `testing/`
  - Testing utilities and guides
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

```{dropdown} GitHub Actions workflow

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`

1. **Setup:** Checkout code, BTRFS storage
2. **Build Optimizations:**
   - Buildah registry cache from GHCR
   - Direct file copies (no bind mounts)
   - 9 separate RUN layers for granular caching
3. **Fetch Base:** Pull `bazzite-nvidia-open:stable`
4. **Build OS:** Build unified KDE image
5. **Build Containers:** Parallel build with matrix strategy
6. **Tag:** Multiple patterns (latest, stable, version+date)
7. **Push:** To `ghcr.io/atrawog/`
8. **Sign:** With cosign (SIGNING_SECRET)
```
